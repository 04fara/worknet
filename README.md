# WorkNET

WorkNET, by an initial purpose, is a website to be used for professional networking, including employer posting their vacancies and employee posting his/her CV. This is just some course work, but not full product, haven't been done yet, done with some features applied to cover the requirements.

As I said, some work is still left. Nothing changed since May 2016.
